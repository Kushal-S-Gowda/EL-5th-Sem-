\# SmartCitySim – AI-Driven Urban Masterplanner



This project implements an AI-based urban planning framework using:



\- Cellular Automata (CA) for spatial suitability

\- Genetic Algorithms (GA) for density, FAR, land-use optimization

\- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for geometric refinement



The system generates regulation-compliant 2D masterplans and is designed

to integrate seamlessly with GIS inputs and 3D Blender-based digital twins.



\## Architecture

CA → GA → PSO → Layout Contract → 2D / 3D Geometry



\## Status

Core engine complete. Visualization via Streamlit. GIS \& Blender integration planned.
